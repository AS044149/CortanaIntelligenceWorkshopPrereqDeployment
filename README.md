# Cortana Intelligence Workshop Prereq Deployment

This GitHub repo exists to deploy the assets needed to complete the Cortana Intelligence Workshop. We are leveraging a capability of Azure called ARM templates which allow you to specifiy what your solution looks like from a deployment perspetive simply by using JSON code. This is a fairly simple use of ARM templates, but you can actually deploy very complex topologies using this technology - straight from source control. Pretty cool!!

All you need to do is click the "Deploy to Azure" button below and fill out the following parameters in Azure. NOTE: you will want to be signed in to your Azure subscription before clicking the button below.
